## General info
Pymaceuticals study: In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 

Observations and Insights: 
1. From all the treatments, Propriva run the least experiments
2. The Capomulin Regimen shows a tumor volume reduction over time
3. There is a high correlation between the average tumor volume and the mice weight on the Capomulin Regimen

## Status
Project is: _finished_, _subject to improvement_.

## Inspiration
Project based on Data Analytics BootCamp homeworks.
